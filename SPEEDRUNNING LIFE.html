            Red Toad shattered the world record in Existence 2 with an astonishing time of 28 minutes and 15 seconds, leaving previous records in the dust.
            To put this in perspective, Red Toad managed to breeze through adolescence and survive a midlife crisis in just 4 minutes. 
            The previous record of 54 minutes now seems slow, making Toad's achievement a jaw-dropping 26 minutes faster.

            For those unfamiliar with the Existence franchise, it's a 3 dimensional game where players control a human navigating the absurdity of life. A game so wildly popular that it’s sold 7 billion copies, making it the best-selling game of all time.

            We had the chance to sit down with Red Toad to talk about this incredible achievement and what it’s like to speedrun through the madness of life. Here’s what he had to say
        </p>
        

        <p class="question">
            <strong>How did you achieve these remarkable results?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Red Toad: "Well I’ve been preparing for 8 months, so it was a very frustrating but rewarding time. My strategy was to find new glitches and to optimize old routes to shave off as much time as I could. I am still suprised that I got it down 28 minutes. A lot of the run came down to tough decision making, one wrong move and I’d be stuck in a midlife crisis."</p>

        <p class="question">
            <strong>During your live run, the level of coordination was impressive. Was that level of precision something you planned out in advance, or did it come together in the moment?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Red Toad: "I planned everything in advance. I remember that I wrote down a list of goals and the exact times I needed to achieve them. I actually have the list in my wallet, here check it out"</p>
