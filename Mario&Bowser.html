        Mario the brooklyn-born hero of the Mushroom kingdom is facing criticism after he reportedly called Bowser a slur during one of their battles.
        Sources close to the situation say that Mario blurted out some hateful slander during the heat of battle as he was spinning Bowser by the tail.
        </p>
        <p>“Things have gotten pretty heated lately between them. Mario is getting really frustrated at Bowser’s constant attempts at kidnapping Princess Peach. During the battle, he just shouted this slur. I know he’s from the 80s but it was really uncalled for.” said a source who wished to remain anonymous.</p>
        <p>“He’s an Italian from Brooklyn who grew up in the 80s, it’s just how he was raised. Let him say it, the Mushroom Kingdom has gotten too woke” said a Red Toad.</p>
