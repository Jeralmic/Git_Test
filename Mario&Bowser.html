    <strong>M</strong>ario the brooklyn-born hero of the Mushroom kingdom is facing criticism after he reportedly called Bowser a slur during one of their battles. <br> 
    Sources close to the situation say that Mario blurted out some hateful slander during the heat of battle as he was spinning Bowser by the tail.
    </p>
    <p>“Things have gotten pretty heated lately between them. Mario is getting really frustrated at Bowser’s constant attempts at kidnapping Princess Peach. During the battle, he just shouted this slur. I know he’s from the 80s but it was really uncalled for.” said a source who wished to remain anonymous.</p>
    <p>“He’s an Italian from Brooklyn who grew up in the 80s, it’s just how he was raised. Let him say it, the Mushroom Kingdom has gotten too woke” said a Red Toad.</p>
